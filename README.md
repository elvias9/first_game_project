### About

Be My Guess is a word guessing game featuring popular movies quotes. 

For my first project of my Javascript course, I decided to combine my passion for movies to my interest in word games.
Be My Guess is a game build with **HTML, responsive CSS, and DOM Manipulation** that challenges your movies knowledge.

### The Game

The game is based on 3 different levels of complexity and you play against a timer. The countdown doesn't change according to the level, therefore you need to solve longer and more complex sentences in the same amount of time.
Movie quotes are randomly selected from three different arrays, according to the level of difficulty.
